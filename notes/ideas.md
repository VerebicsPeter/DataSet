# Ideas

## To-Do

- [ ] Read about contrastive learning and contra code

## Equivalence

### Arithmetic

- [ ] `+` and `*` are commutative
- [ ] `+` and `*` are associative
- [ ] `*` is distributive on `+` and `-`

### Logic

- [x] `(not not a)` is `(a)`
- [x] De Morgan's law

### Rename

- [ ] a variable, function or class can be renamed to a **new** name
- [ ] a **new** alias can be introduced for any import

### Trivial

- [ ] a `pass` can be introduced at the end of any `def`
- [ ] a `continue` can be introduced at the end of any `for`

### Other

- [ ] `try: open(...) excep: ...` to `with open(...)`

## Implementation

- Create smaller 'sub-patterns' for more complex transformations (i.e.: for transformations)
- Make rules bidirectional
