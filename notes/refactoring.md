# Refactoring ideas

## "Harder" refactorings to implement

- extract variable (extract a complex expression into a variable)
- extract methods/functions (extracting a block of code into a new funtion)
- inline a method/function (replace calls with definition)
- introducing getters and setters for attributes
- swapping lines if it produces equivalent code

## Tools to try

- IDE's built in tools
- `Bowler`
- Python fixers like `modernize`
- `PyUpgrade`
- formatters like `autopep8` or `black`
